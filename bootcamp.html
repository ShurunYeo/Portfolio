                    This was another one of our university course where we learned how to program based on JAVA 
                    while using the "Processing" text editor. Every lecture, we were introduced to more and more
                    functionality of programming. Then we were given assignments to create program which fit the 
                    general instructions.

                        This is a simple game created by coding. The purpose of the game is to get the ball
                        from the left to the right. If the ball touches the boxes, the you lose the game. 
                        Every time the game runs, the boxes are in different order.

                        This was the last task, and I had to create something while using everything that 
                        I had learned during the bootcamp. This code produces an interactive artwork where 
                        each of the circles clicked changes the color pallet of the entire artwork.
