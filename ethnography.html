                This was a course within the first block of the first semester. 
                The goal of this course was to start training to be a great UX Designer 
                by targeting a specific user group to find out information about them 
                and to know their needs. These information about the users were gathered 
                by Observation, Semi-Structured Interviews and Ethnographic interviews. 
                With the data collected, I made insights, and with those insights, 
                conclusions were made regarding how to solve their user problems with design elements.

                The user group that I have chosen was "BTS Fans". My goal was to know more about
                this specific user group, and to know how their useability needs were affected 
                by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    In this stage, I looked for 3 different sub-cultures (Dutch National Football team fans, Architecture Students in TU Delft, BTS Fans). However, I chose to carry on my research with BTS Fans because I thought it would be an interesting topic to cover during COVID-19. After selecting my subculture, I went and recruited 2 members of the subculture as my research participants.

                <div class="uni_description_text">
                    Before heading into first hand research, I prepared my knowledge of the subculture by doing some desk research. This was done online by looking at articles, news and sources directly and indirectly related to the subculture. Through this, I made basic assumptions of BTS fans (Armies).

                <div class="uni_description_text">
                    This stage was me observing what BTS fans would do in their daily lives. I was invited to the fans meeting. I had the privilege of experiencing the subculture with my eyes. The data was recorded by taking handwritten notes. This gave me a chance to learn more about the subculture that I have chosen, and it helped me prepare for the following interviews.

                    The semi-structured interview is an interview where there is a structure but with the availability of being less formal when needed. I made a protocol with the specific topics and questions I was going to ask the interviewee. The questions were formed by further curiosities I had about the subculture. The session was recorded and made into a transcript for an easier evaluation later on.

                    The ethnographic interview is different compared to the previous one because there is no structure to the interview. The interview is more like a conversation where I could gather data in a more natural way. This session as well was recorded and made into a transcript for an easier evaluation later on.

                    With the data I had collected about BTS fans from the desk research, observation, semi-structured interview and ethnographic interview, I converted interesting insights and information into data cards. The data cards were then used to make an affinity diagram where I could cluster the data and comprehend them better. Through this I was able to create more insights and the insights were used to create HMW (How Might We) Questions.

                    With the HMW questions, I came up with ideas to solve the problems. For each HMW question, I came up with 3 concept ideas which were aimed to be a solution to user problems or user needs of the selected subculture. The concepts are meant to be a starting point into designing a product for the subculture. My ideas were created by digitally sketching them.
